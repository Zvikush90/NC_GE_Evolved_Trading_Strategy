To run the program, copy all of the GE Program folder into a new directory.
Execute "run_ponyge.py" in the folder GE Program\src

The following files were modified from PonyGE2 for this project:
\src\fitness\pymax.py "trading.py" - The fitness function and stock selection
\grammars\pymax.pybnf "trading.pybnf" - The grammar
\parameters\pymax.txt "trading.txt" - Parameters file

Contact me with any questions and I would be happy to help!

Thanks to Michael Fenton for his support in implementing the powerful PonyGE2 library.

The finance industry is often quick to adopt new technology and the application of natural computing techniques is a contemporary research area. This project aimed to derive and test genetically evolved trading strategies with a grammatical evolution algorithm. Four S&P 500 stocks were modelled over a 17-year period and trading strategies were generated. The results were marginally more profitable than a benchmark buy and hold strategy.
