To run the program, copy all of the GE Program folder into a new directory.
Execute "run_ponyge.py" in the folder GE Program\src

\src\fitness\pymax.py "trading.py" - The fitness function and stock selection
\grammars\pymax.pybnf "trading.pybnf" - The grammar
\parameters\pymax.txt "trading.txt" - Parameters file

Contact me with any questions and I would be happy to help!
